A theme designed to make your Obsidian workspace look and feel like wikipedia.org! 

## ‚≠ê Features
- Wikipedia-style headings, titles, tabs, sidebars, and more.
- Support for inline metadata and tables created with the Dataview plugin.
- Images and callouts float to the side.
- Works on mobile devices.

## ‚òùüèΩ Notes
- Some of the css was taken directly from wikipedia.org and mapped to components in Obsidian.
- This theme makes dividers invisible. 
  - This was a creative choice, as Wikipedia articles do not use dividers. 
- *For optimal viewing quality, go to **Editor** in **Settings** and **turn off Readable Line Length***.
- This theme is not compatible with dark mode.
- I'm not a theme developer or anything, just a 15-year-old who likes to play with css.
