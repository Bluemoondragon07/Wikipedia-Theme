A theme designed to make your Obsidian workspace look and feel like wikipedia.org! 

## ⭐ Features
- Wikipedia-style headings, titles, tabs, sidebars, and more.
- Support for inline metadata and tables created with the Dataview plugin.
- Images and callouts float to the side (Can be changed with style settings).
- Works on mobile devices.

## ☝🏽 Notes
- Some of the css was taken directly from wikipedia.org and mapped to components in Obsidian.
- This theme makes dividers invisible. 
  - This was a creative choice, as Wikipedia articles do not use dividers. 
- *For optimal viewing quality, go to **Editor** in **Settings** and **turn off Readable Line Length***.
- I'm not a theme developer or anything, just a 15-year-old who likes to play with css.

## 🎉 Update
- Now supports Dark Mode!
### 🎨 Style Settings
- You can now choose to use your own accent color rather than Wikipedia's blue!
- Blockquotes can be formatted either like Wikipedia quotes or like infoboxes
- Images and infoboxes can be centered (I recommend this if you'd like to keep Readable Line Length turned off)
- You can now change image size (only applied if images are centered)
